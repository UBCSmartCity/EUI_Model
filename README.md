## About
The goal of this research project is to advance the accuracy of energy demand forecasting for a group of buildings, thereby minimizing the variability in estimating base load and storage requirements for a given area. And doing so, one can significantly reduce the costs associated with incorporating renewable energy into existing energy systems or developing a new sustainable infrastructure.

This script automates and simplifies the process of acquiring data from both Skyspark and GeoJSON.

### Prerequisites
Pandas & GeoPandas

Folder directory example:
```
dataset/
    ubcv_buildings/
        ubcv_buildings.geojson
        Hennings/
            _Hennings_edit.csv -> (output)
            Hennings_Elec_Energy.csv
            Hennings_Elec_Power.csv
            Hennings_Thrm_Energy.csv
            Hennings_Thrm_Power.csv
            Hennings_Wtr_Cns.csv
```


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>
```python
Merge the 5 files under the folder 
a = prep.Collection(build_name, data_dir)
b = a.skyspark()
```

```python
Parse units and re-arrange columns
a2 = prep.Transformation(b)
c = a2.parse_arrange(list_of_col)
```

```python
Get data from geojson
d = a.geojson(c)
```

```python
Compute EUI after entering the GFA data
e = a.eui(d)
```

```python
Output dataframe as .csv file
prep.csv_output(dir, build_name, e, 'edit')
```

### Tasks
- [ ] Use flags to help detect error (flags.txt)
- [ ] Simplify the merge, fill_col(), and compute EUI process
- [x] Add GeoJson capability
    - Reasech through building code -> and grab info -> fill col
