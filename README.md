## About
The goal of this research project is to advance the accuracy of energy demand forecasting for a group of buildings, thereby minimizing the variability in estimating base load and storage requirements for a given area. And doing so, one can significantly reduce the costs associated with incorporating renewable energy into existing energy systems or developing a new sustainable infrastructure.

This script automates and simplifies the process of acquiring data from both Skyspark and GeoJSON.

                ]
```

```python
# 1. Merge the 5 files under the folder 
a = prep.Collection(build_name, data_dir)
b = a.skyspark()
```

```python
# 2. Parse units and re-arrange columns
a2 = prep.Transformation(b)
c = a2.parse_arrange(list_of_col)
```

```python
# 3. Get data from geojson
d = a.geojson(c) 
```

```python
# 4. Compute EUI after entering the GFA data
e = a.eui(d) \
```

```python
# 5. Output dataframe as .csv file
prep.csv_output(dir, build_name, e, 'edit')
